## 🧭 Chapter 1: Origins

Once a student of circuits and volts, I found myself tangled not in wires, but in logic.  
With a degree in Electrical Engineering from Amravati University in hand, I wandered into the world of web — where creativity and logic met like electrons and nodes.

## 🔥 Chapter 2: The Awakening

Here began my **MERN Stack** journey:  
A realm of:
- 💡 JavaScript 
- 🧩 React 
- ⚙️ Node 
- 🧱 MongoDB 

I forged projects from raw ideas:
- ✨ Glamour-Clone: A shopping spell
- 🏋️‍♂️ FitnessClub: The temple of health
- 🛒 BigBasket-Clone: Magic groceries
- 👕 Bewakoof-Clone: Clothes for the code-born

## 🛠️ Chapter 3: Tools of the Trade

Like any explorer, I carried gear:
- **🧠 Intelligence:** ChatGPT, Grok, GitHub Copilot  
- **💻 Blacksmith's tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Postman  
- **🕵️‍♂️ Defense spells:** Burp Suite, John the Ripper  
- **📊 Scrolls of Insight:** MS Office, Power BI

And write functions like sonnets.

## 🧙 Chapter 6: The Oath

> "May my code be clean, my logic clear, and my mission meaningful."

With every `console.log`, every bug squashed, every push to main —  
I inch closer to the legend I aim to become.
